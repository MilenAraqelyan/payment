#Setting up Stripe Integration in Laravel
This guide will walk you through setting up Stripe integration in a Laravel application. We'll start by creating a Stripe account and generating API keys, followed by creating a product in Stripe and storing the product ID in a .env file. Finally, we'll create a client for the Laravel application, migrate the database, and start the development server.

Prerequisites
Before we begin, you'll need the following:

A Laravel application (version 5.6 or higher)
Composer installed
A Stripe account (if you don't have one, you can create one at https://dashboard.stripe.com/register)
Step 1: Create a Stripe Account and Generate API Keys
To integrate Stripe into your Laravel application, you'll need to create a Stripe account and generate API keys. Here's how to do it:

Go to https://dashboard.stripe.com/register and create a Stripe account.

Once you've created your account, go to the Stripe dashboard and navigate to the API Keys page.

You'll see two keys: a Publishable key and a Secret key. Copy these keys and store them in a .env file at the root of your Laravel application.

#Migrate the Database and Start the Development Server.

php artisan migrate

create:client

php artisan serve
